# nyu-24-spring-mini-project

the mini project of the nyu 24 spring deep learning course. We have optimized the ResNet18 by changing the readitional convolution into dw convolution, which limit the number of parameters with in 1.2million, and achieved the accuracy about 89%. And in the pure_without_startup.ipynb, we use the data augmentation with horizontal flip, rotation and crop, we also scheduler to optimize our model. After training for 40 epochs, we get 91% accuracy on the test batch.
